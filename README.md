# Send-em-Soup-Project
Simple Python program with a Tkinter GUI to test out the interface for the silly idea of mailing someone a can of soup.

User Manual
This is to be used as the "User Manual" for the project. 

Once the software begins, choose to Begin {shopping} or to Exit.
Exit will shut down the program while Begin will jump the user right into the products.

An ultra simple interface is presented to the user that allows them to scroll through the different options {left and right arrows} or to click "Order" if that is the product that you would like to purchase.
Scrolling through the different options will loop you back to where you started.
An EXIT button was not added to the program since the software can always be closed by selecting the "X" in the upper right corner of the main screen.

Clicking "Order" takes you to the ordering page where you are asked to enter all of the required info to ship someone one of the products. Nothing here is verified though it is all given an example as to what is expected.

If you user would like to back out and review the options again, the "Return" button will shunt them back to the product listing loop where they can continue to review the different choices.

Filling out the Ordering Form and then pressing "Order" would then output the entered text in the form to the termial line (if it worked). Currently, it outputs the example text no matter what is typed into the form ... which is frustrating and something that I couldn't sort out no matter how hard I tried.

Moving forward, if you did fill out the form and click "Order", it presents the user with a Pop-Up window indicating that the user has succesfully "Sent Them Soup".

They then are sent to the "Thank You" page that has a single button that exits the program.
